# OpenGL Minecraft Clone

This project demonstrates advanced skills in designing and implementing complex systems using C++, OpenGL, and Make. It features a functional prototype of infinite world generation inspired by Minecraft, including dynamic chunk loading/unloading, user navigation, and block placement. Developed with a focus on performance and optimization, it is intended to run efficiently on Linux. The source code showcases expertise in graphics programming, resource management, and systems development.
